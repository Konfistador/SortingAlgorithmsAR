\section{Introduction}
TODO: Write about the purpose of this section, when you finish writing it.
  
\subsection{Context and Background}
		- History of Algorithms.
		- Modern Usage, developments.
		- Maybe some discussion on sorting algorithms(if present somewhere and can be quoted).
\subsection{Hypothesis, Problems and Considerations}
		- Our Hypothesis that we are going to see a linear growth of the Time Complexity, towards Size of Collection.
		- What is Time Complexity ?
		- Why is Time Complexity important? 
		-  What could affect the Time Complexity.
		- External factors that can affect the Time Complexity.
		\subsubsection{Time Complexity and the importance of it.}
		\subsubsection{Factors, operating on Time Complexity.}
		\subsubsection{Different methods of approaching our Research question.}
